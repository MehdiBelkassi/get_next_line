# get_next_line
The Get Next Line project was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of core programming concepts in C. I gained expertise in working with file descriptors, learning how to manage multiple streams of input simultaneously while maintaining data consistency with static variables. Through this project, I enhanced my ability to implement efficient buffer management strategies to optimize file reading operations. I also developed a strong grasp of dynamic memory allocation, ensuring proper resizing and freeing of memory to handle varying input sizes without leaks. Writing utility functions for string manipulation allowed me to refine my problem-solving and modular programming skills. Additionally, I became adept at identifying and addressing edge cases, improving the robustness of my code. Adhering to the Norminette standard further polished my ability to write clean, structured, and maintainable code under strict guidelines. Overall, this project strengthened my proficiency in low-level programming, memory management, and file I/O, giving me tools to approach more complex coding challenges confidently.
